# Clear Steam Account Cache
Simple script to remove local steam account data before switching to alt accounts, potentially helps with dissociating trust factor between CS2/CSGO accounts. Does not mitigate Valve HWID fingerprinting.

## Usage (Windows)
Run the Windows batch script to remove Windows registry keys associated with Steam and clear Steam userdata / appcache from the `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\` directory.

The Windows batch script assumes your steam install is located at: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\`, if you have installed Steam in a different directory modify the script and paste in your install location
